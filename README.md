Solutions for C# &amp; SQL interview questions on https://www.testdome.com

A recruiter approached me with a job offer which I accepted very excitingly. I had to pass a test before proceeding with the next step of the hiring process. The recruiter sent me a link to testdome.com. The test was time-boxed and I had only one chance to pass the test. Unfortunately, I could not pass the test within the limited amount of time. 
The tests were daunting because it challenged me, so I took my time to do all of the interesting tests and posted the solutions here.
